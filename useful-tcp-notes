Useful notes from the RFC document


Note that when the receive window is zero no segments should be acceptable except ACK
segments. Thus, it is possible for a TCP implementation to maintain a zero receive window while
MUST
transmitting data and receiving ACKs. A TCP receiver process the RST and URG fields of all
incoming segments, even when the receive window is zero (MUST-66).
